# AJT-WordPress
Wordpress Site for AlphaJTravel, a travel agency

This is the first full wordpress site I have worked on, and in the interest of learning all I can, I am attempting to do as much from scratch as possible.

To start with I have a plugin for a promos style post type which I will use to create a carosel that will display the featured image of the promo as well as relevant info.  I will also be making the requisite template files.
